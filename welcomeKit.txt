#Git commands
1.Create branch in git flow below command

	$git branch your_new_branch_name;						//create new branch
	$git checkout your_new_branch_name;						//switch to your new branch
	
	!!above to commands can be condensed into below one command
	$git checkout -b your_new_branch_name;
	
	$git checkout -u origin your_new_branch_name;			//send the new branches new origin to remote repository.

2.To switch to another existing branch follow below command

3.To avoid logging into git for each push, pull, fetch ..etc execute below command

	$git config --global credential.helper wincred;

4.Rename your last git commit-message with new_message

	$git commit; --amend

5.Git command to store your changes locally in a copy so that you can go on working with some other task and come back and re-apply those stored changes on your branch.

	$git stash;			//to store the local changes in a temporary copy.
	$git stash pop;		//to re-apply your stored changes on the branch.

	NOTE: popping your stash removes your changes from stash and reapplies them to your branch and hence they won't be available anymore to re-apply the same changes on to some other branch.

6. retain your changes in git stash locally so that you can apply the same changes on multiple branches...below is the command to apply this way on your branch is as follow so that the stash changes will be still available to apply on to another branch.
	
	$git stash apply;
	
7. git stash to stash untracked files as well with flag -u (or --include-untracked) which tells git to stash to also stash your untracked files
